# Overview
This fork enables exporting annotations made in [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) into local files in markdown format. This way it simplifies integration of web-annotation workflows into daily note processing with personal knowledge management apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/).

For more details on how the general API for hypothes.is works, please visit the [original repo](https://github.com/judell/h_notify).
